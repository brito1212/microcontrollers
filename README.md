# Microcontrollers and Microprocessors Laboratory Repository

Welcome to the Microcontrollers and Microprocessors Laboratory repository! This repository is dedicated to storing code and materials related to various lab classes in the field of microcontrollers and microprocessors. Each folder corresponds to a specific lab class, focusing on GPIO control and exploring the details of the STM32F103C8 microcontroller using C and Keil uVision ARM IDE.

## Lab Classes

### Lab Class 1: Introduction to STM32F103C8 Microcontroller

Description: This lab class introduces the STM32F103C8 microcontroller, covers its features, and sets up the development environment.

- Folder: `Lab1`
- Files: `main.c`

### Lab Class 2: GPIO Control and Digital Inputs/Outputs

Description: Configure and control GPIO pins for digital outputs, using LEDs.

- Folder: `Lab2`
- Files: `main.c`, `externos.h`, `internos.h`

### Lab Class 3: LCD Control

Description: Configure and control LCD display. Using the Switches to control what is displayed.
- Folder: `Lab3`
- Files: `main.c`, `externos.h`, `internos.h`

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/microcontrollers-lab.git


2. Open the Keil uVision ARM IDE and import the project located in the specific lab class folder you're interested in.

3. Compile and build the project in the Keil uVision IDE.

4. Flash the resulting binary onto your STM32F103C8 microcontroller.

5. Experiment with the code, modify parameters, and observe the behavior on the microcontroller.
